# Jupyter: updating matplotlib figure from within a loop
I've become very fond of Jupyter as a front-end to my scientific libraries. Before Jupyter, I would primarily use MATLAB for algorithm development and testing, for which MATLAB's plotting tools were useful for visualising features of interest during an algorithm's runtime.

Updating a matplotlib figure within Jupyter was not an obvious task for me. I made a few attempts to get it working with no success, but eventually pieced together a working example from various posts I found during my searches.

I have no doubt there will be better ways to do this. If you're aware of one please let me know.

I hope you find the below examples useful. The first one clears the axes before plotting, the second one doesn't.
